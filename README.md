# Lakehouse Demo - Azure Data Engineering

## 📋 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **modern Data Lakehouse architecture** on Azure with the layers **Bronze (raw data)** → **Silver (cleaned)** → **Gold (aggregated)**. Generated test data is provided via **Azure Blob Storage** and processed through **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** pipelines and Python-based ETL processes. The goal is a complete Data Engineering setup with transformation, validation, and analytics-ready data.
